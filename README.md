# Text Based Adventures

An implementation of a text based game inspired by the 80's famous [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).

It adds endpoints that can easily be plugged to the webhook of a [Twilio's](https://www.twilio.com/) phone, 
allowing you to play by sending SMS or by doing phone calls.
